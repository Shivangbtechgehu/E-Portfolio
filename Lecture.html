    <h1>PESE400: Employability Skill Enhancement - Lecture Logs</h1>

    <!-- Lecture 1 -->
    <div class="lecture">
        <h3>Lecture 1 - 03/02/2025</h3>
        <p>Today was our first practical lecture for Employability Skill Enhancement (PESE400). I was absent because I am out of town.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lecture 2 -->
    <div class="lecture">
        <h3>Lecture 2 - 10/02/2025</h3>
        <p>Today's lecture was very interesting because sir played three mind games with us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We had to do the opposite of the instructions given by sir.</li>
            <li>We had to say a word similar to the last word spoken by someone else.</li>
            <li>We had to describe the work of a pencil apart from writing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Through these activities, I learned about the functioning of the left brain. The outcome of these games was that we improved our creativity, quick thinking, and ability to break habitual patterns. It helped us realize the importance of flexible thinking in problem-solving.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lecture 3 -->
    <div class="lecture">
        <h3>Lecture 3 - 17/02/2025</h3>
        <p>Today I was absent because I am not feeling well. I attended the morning lectures, but after that, I got a headache. However, I found out that today sir talked to us about the profile sheet. I learned that the profile sheet is an important tool for showcasing our skills, achievements, and professional experiences, which can be very useful for career development. I found out that today, sir taught us how to give a professional introduction.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lecture 4 -->
    <div class="lecture">
        <h3>Lecture 4 - 25/02/2025</h3>
        <p>Today, sir gave us a surprise task where we had to form a group of 5–6 students and present a business idea in front of investors (the audience). Sir gave us 30 minutes to prepare, but we were unable to perform today due to a shortage of time.</p>
        <div class="ppt-download">

        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Lecture 5 -->
    <div class="lecture">
        <h3>Lecture 5 - 04/03/2025</h3>
        <p>Today, we had to present our business idea. After 2–3 teams, our turn came, and my teammates and I presented the idea we had prepared. We delivered the presentation very well. After our turn, the remaining teams presented their ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lecture 6 -->
    <div class="lecture">
        <h3>Lecture 6 - 08/04/2025</h3>
        <p>In today's lecture, sir taught us about group discussions (GD), types of GDs, and the do's and don'ts of GD. It was a very informative lecture.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lecture 7 -->
    <div class="lecture">
        <h3>Lecture 7 - 15/04/2025</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, sir made 5 groups consisting of 10 students each. Sir noted some fields on the board, and one of the members had to tell an underdog of that field. I chose sports and picked Karun Nair as an underdog player. He has the record of 300 not out in his 2nd test but hasn't had much chance to show his potential, which is why I chose him.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lecture 8 -->
    <div class="lecture">
        <h3>Lecture 8 - 22/04/2025</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, sir called us in a group of 10 for a group discussion on the topic "Is AI a Boon or Bane?" When my turn came, I spoke in favor of the topic and started with the quote: "AI is not here to replace us but to empower us." After that, I also gave my input. From this lecture, I learned how to conclude a GD and other useful things like body posture, speaking skills, and more.</p>
